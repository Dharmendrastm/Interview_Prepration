TOP 30 Cybersecurity Interview Ques ons [For Freshers] 
1. What is CIA Triad’s? 
The CIA Triad is a founda onal model in cybersecurity, standing for Confiden ality, Integrity, 
and Availability. It outlines the three essen al principles that ensure the protec on of data 
and systems. 
a. Confiden ality: - Refers to protec ng sensi ve informa on from unauthorized access 
or disclosure. 
b.  Integrity: - Refers to maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data and ensuring 
that is not tempered with or modified in an unauthorized manner. 
c.  
Availability: - Refers to ensuring that systems, data and resources are available and 
accessible to authorized users when needed. 
2. What is AAA?  
It is stands for Authen ca on, Authoriza on, and Accoun ng. It is a framework for 
controlling access to resources, ensuring proper iden ty verifica on, and tracking the use of 
system resources. 
a. Authen ca on: - The process of verifying the iden fy a user, device, or system 
a emp ng a access a network or resources. 
b. Authoriza on: - The process of gran ng access to specific resources or informa on based 
on user’s iden ty, role, or privileges. 
c. Accoun ng: - This refers to tracking and recording the ac ons performed by a user or 
system. It helps monitor ac vi es, create logs, and maintain an audit trail for future 
analysis or compliance purposes. 
3. What is difference between stateful and stateless firewall? 
Parameters  
Stateful 
Philosophy 
Stateless 
Stateful firewalls maintain 
context about ac ve sessions 
and use “state informa on” 
to speed packets processing 
Filtering decision 
Treats each packet in 
isola on and does not relates 
to connec on state. 
Based on flows and 
connec on state (analyses 
packet sequences). 
Memory and CPU intensive 
Based solely on informa on 
in packet headers (IP 
address, port number, etc 
High (requires resources to 
maintain state informa on 
for each connec on). 
Security 
High (tracks connec on 
state, providing deeper 
inspec on). 
Low (does not track 
connec ons, so uses fewer 
resources). 
Low (does not track 
connec on state, making it 
easier to bypass security) 
Connec on Status 
Known (tracks the state of 
the connec on). 
Performance 
Unknown (each packet is 
treated independently). 
Slower (due to the overhead 
of tracking connec on 
states). 
Related terms 
Faster (since it doesn't track 
state or maintain connec on 
informa on). 
State informa on, pa ern 
matching etc. 
Header info, IP address, port 
no etc.

4. Explain DDOS a ack and how to mi gate it? 
This again is an important Cybersecurity Interview Ques on. A DDOS (Distributed Denial of 
Service) a ack is a cybera ack that causes the servers to refuse to provide services to genuine 
clients. DDOS a ack can be classified into two types:  
1.  Flooding a acks: In this type, the hacker sends a huge amount of traffic to the server 
which the server cannot handle. And hence, the server stops func oning. This type of 
a ack is usually executed by using automated programs that con nuously send packets to 
the server.  
2. Crash a acks: In this type, the hackers exploit a bug on the server resul ng in the system 
to crash and hence the server is not able to provide service to the clients.  
You can prevent DDOS a acks by using the following prac ces: 
 Use An-DDOS services  
 Configure Firewalls and Routers  
 Use Front-End Hardware  
 Use Load Balancing  
 Handle Spikes in Traffic 
5. Differen ate between Vulnerability Assessment and Penetra on Tes ng? 
Vulnerability Assessment is the process of finding flaws on the target. Here, the organiza on 
knows that their system/network has flaws or weaknesses and want to find these flaws and 
priori ze the flaws for fixing. 
Penetra on Tes ng is the process of finding vulnerabili es on the target. In this case, the 
organiza on would have set up all the security measures they could think of and would want to 
test if there is any other way that their system/network can be hacked. 
6. What are the common types of cyber security a acks? 
Phishing: A ackers send fraudulent emails or messages that appear to come from reputable sources, 
aiming to trick users into revealing sensi ve informa on like passwords or financial details. 
Malware: Malicious so ware, including viruses, ransomware, worms, and spyware, designed to 
damage or exploit systems. Ransomware, for example, encrypts data and demands payment for its 
release. 
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) A acks: A ackers intercept communica on between two par es to steal 
data, creden als, or insert malicious content. This o en happens on unsecured or public Wi-Fi 
networks. 
Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): A ackers flood a system or network 
with excessive traffic, overwhelming it and causing legi mate requests to be denied. 
TOP 30 Cybersecurity Interview Ques ons [For Freshers] 
SQL Injec on: A ackers insert malicious SQL code into a web applica on's database query, allowing 
them to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to the database. 
Cross-Site Scrip ng (XSS): A ackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, which then execute 
in the vicm's browser, poten ally leading to session hijacking or data the . 
Password A acks: These include brute force, dic onary a acks, and creden al stuffing, where 
a ackers a empt to guess or crack passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems. 
Insider Threats: Malicious or careless employees, contractors, or business partners who have access 
to sensi ve informa on and misuse or expose it. 
Zero-Day Exploits: A acks that target vulnerabili es in so ware that are unknown to the so ware 
vendor and have no available patches. 
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Long-term targeted a acks, o en by na on-states or well
funded a ackers, designed to steal sensi ve informa on or disrupt opera ons. 
7.  What is difference between hashing and encryp on? 
Both Encryp on and Hashing are used to convert readable data into an unreadable format. The 
difference is that the encrypted data can be converted back to original data by the process of 
decryp on but the hashed data cannot be converted back to original data. 
8. What are the different layers of the OSI model? 
An OSI model is a reference model for how applica ons communicate over a network. The 
purpose of an OSI reference is to guide vendors and developers so the digital communica on 
products and soware programs can interoperate. 
Following are the OSI layers:  
Physical Layer: Responsible for transmission of digital data from sender to receiver through the 
communica on media,  
Data Link Layer: Handles the movement of data to and from the physical link. It is also 
responsible for encoding and decoding of data bits. 
Network Layer: Responsible for packet forwarding and providing rou ng paths for network 
communica on.  
Transport Layer: Responsible for end-to-end communica on over the network. It splits the data 
from the above layer and passes it to the Network Layer and then ensures that all the data has 
successfully reached at the receiver’s end. 
Session Layer: Controls connec on between the sender and the receiver. It is responsible for 
star ng, ending, and managing the session and establishing, maintaining and synchronizing 
interac on between the sender and the receiver.  
Presenta on Layer: It deals with presen ng the data in a proper format and data structure 
instead of sending raw datagrams or packets.  
Applica on Layer: It provides an interface between the applica on and the network. It focuses 
on process-to-process communica on and provides a communica on interface.

9. What is TCP 3-way Handshake? 
A three-way handshake is a method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connec on between a 
host and a client. It’s called a three-way handshake because it is a three-step method in which 
the client and server exchanges packets. 
The three steps are as follows:  
1. The client sends a SYN(Synchronize) packet to the server check if the server is up or has open 
ports  
2. The server sends SYN-ACK packet to the client if it has open ports  
3. The client acknowledges this and sends an ACK(Acknowledgment) packet back to the server                            
10. What’s the difference between a white box test and a black box test? 
White Box Testing: Testers have full knowledge of the internal structure, design, and 
implementation of the software or system. This includes access to source code, architecture, and 
algorithms. 
Black Box Testing: Testers have no knowledge of the internal workings. They evaluate the system 
solely based on its inputs and outputs without understanding the underlying code or 
architecture. 
11. What is the difference between Vulnerability, Risk and Threat? 
Vulnerability: A weakness in a system (e.g., unpatched software). 
Risk: The potential for loss associated with exploiting a vulnerability (e.g., data breach risk). 
Threat: The potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability (e.g., cybercriminals). 
12. What are HIDS and NIDS? 
HIDS (Host IDS) and NIDS (Network IDS) are both Intrusion Detec on System and work for the 
same purpose i.e., to detect the intrusions. The only difference is that the HIDS is set up on a 
par cular host/device. It monitors the traffic of a par cular device and suspicious system 
ac vi es. On the other hand, NIDS is set up on a network. It monitors traffic of all device of the 
network. 
13. What is Indicator of Compromise? 
An Indicator of Compromise (IoC) is a piece of evidence or data that suggests a security breach 
or malicious activity has occurred in a system or network. IoCs are like digital breadcrumbs left 
behind by attackers that can help cybersecurity teams identify, detect, and respond to potential 
threats or ongoing attacks. 
14. What are OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabili es? 
The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most cri cal web applica on security risks, compiled by the 
Open Web Applica on Security Project (OWASP). It provides guidance to developers, security 
teams, and organiza ons on addressing the most common and impac ul vulnerabili es. The 
most recent OWASP Top 10 list (2021) includes the following: 
1. Broken Access Control: 
 Descrip on: Flaws that allow users to act outside their intended permissions, such as gaining 
unauthorized access to restricted resources. 
TOP 30 Cybersecurity Interview Ques ons [For Freshers] 
 Example: A normal user modifying a URL to access an admin page. 
2. Cryptographic Failures: 
 Descrip on: Weak or improperly implemented cryptographic mechanisms that expose 
sensi ve data. 
 Example: Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak encryp on algorithms like MD5. 
3. Injec on: 
 Descrip on: Inser ng malicious code into a program, o en through user inputs, to execute 
unintended commands or queries. 
 Example: SQL injec on, where an a acker can manipulate a database query by injec ng SQL 
code. 
4. Insecure Design: 
 Descrip on: Flaws resul ng from the absence of security in the design of applica ons, o en 
due to lack of security controls in the design phase. 
 Example: No proper valida on on inputs allowing for a acks like XSS. 
5. Security Misconfigura on: 
 Descrip on: Improper configura on of security se ngs in applica ons, servers, or 
databases, exposing systems to a acks. 
 Example: Leaving default accounts ac ve, unnecessary features enabled, or error messages 
revealing too much informa on. 
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components: 
 Descrip on: Using libraries, frameworks, or other components with known vulnerabili es 
can introduce security risks. 
 Example: Running an outdated version of a so ware library that is vulnerable to known 
a acks. 
7. Iden fica on and Authen ca on Failures: 
 Descrip on: Weak authen ca on mechanisms or improper session handling, which allow 
a ackers to compromise user iden es. 
 Example: Allowing weak passwords or session hijacking due to insecure token handling. 
8. Soware and Data Integrity Failures: 
 Descrip on: Failures related to soware updates, cri cal data, or CI/CD pipelines not being 
properly verified for integrity. 
 Example: Allowing unsigned or untrusted soware updates, which could lead to 
compromise. 
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: 
 Descrip on: Lack of sufficient logging, monitoring, or response mechanisms, leading to 
undetected a acks and delayed incident response. 
 Example: Not logging failed login a empts or ignoring alerts for suspicious ac vity. 
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): 
 Descrip on: An a acker tricks a server into making unintended requests to other resources, 
poten ally exposing sensi ve internal systems. 
 Example: Exploi ng an API to make the server fetch unauthorized data from internal 
networks. 
15. What is SSL Handshake? 
The network is important for office, home, and business networks. The problem is at the utmost 
places wireless communica on is used or we can say the wireless network is used which is 
effortlessly hackable and the router can be freely exploited if not secured rightly. So there’s a 
TOP 30 Cybersecurity Interview Ques ons [For Freshers] 
need for security in the network. To fulfill this need we can use security protocols or 
cryptographic protocols to deliver authen ca on and data security. 
16. What is a Cyber Kill Chain? 
The cyber kill chain is an adapta on of the military’s kill chain, which is a step-by-step approach 
that iden fies and stops enemy ac vity. Originally developed by Lockheed Mar n in 2011, the 
cyber kill chain outlines the various stages of several common cybera acks and, by extension, 
the points at which the informa on security team can prevent, detect or intercept a ackers. 
17. How does Traceroute work? 
A traceroute works by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, and every 
router involved in transferring the data gets these packets. The ICMP packets provide 
informa on about whether the routers used in the transmission are able to effec vely transfer 
the data. 
18. What is Incident response process? 
Incident Response Process: Establish a clear sequence of steps for incident detec on, 
containment, eradica on, recovery, and post-incident review. Ownership and Responsibility: 
Assign specific roles for each stage of the response process, with clear tles and contact details 
for each team member. 
19. What is PKI? 
Public key infrastructure is an important aspect of internet security. It is the set of technology 
and processes that make up a framework of encryp on to protect and authen cate digital 
communica ons.  
PKI uses cryptographic public keys that are connected to a digital cer ficate, which authen cates 
the device or user sending the digital communica on. Digital cer ficates are issued by a trusted 
source, a cer ficate authority (CA), and act as a type of digital passport to ensure that the sender 
is who they say they are. 
Public key infrastructure protects and authen cates communica ons between servers and users, 
such as between your website (hosted on your web server) and your clients (the user trying to 
connect through their browser. It can also be used for secure communica ons within an 
organiza on to ensure that the messages are only visible to the sender and recipient, and they 
have not been tampered with in transit.  
The main components of public key infrastructure include the following: 
 Cer ficate authority (CA): The CA is a trusted en ty that issues, stores, and signs the digital 
cer ficate. The CA signs the digital cer ficate with their own private key and then publishes 
the public key that can be accessed upon request. 
 Registra on authority (RA): The RA verifies the iden ty of the user or device reques ng the 
digital cer ficate. This can be a third party, or the CA can also act as the RA.   
 Cer ficate database: This database stores the digital cer ficate and its metadata, which 
includes how long the cer ficate is valid. 
 Central directory: This is the secure loca on where the cryptographic keys are indexed and 
stored.   
TOP 30 Cybersecurity Interview Ques ons [For Freshers] 
 Cer ficate management system: This is the system for managing the delivery of cer ficates 
as well as access to them.   
 Cer ficate policy: This policy outlines the procedures of the PKI. It can be used by outsiders 
to determine the PKI’s trustworthiness. 
20. What is SQL Injec on? 
SQL injec on (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an a acker to interfere with the 
queries that an applica on makes to its database. This can allow an a acker to view data that 
they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any 
other data that the applica on can access. In many cases, an a acker can modify or delete this 
data, causing persistent changes to the applica on's content or behaviour. 
21. What is Zero-day vulnerability? 
"Zero day" refers to the fact that the soware or device vendor has zero days to fix the flaw 
because malicious actors can already use it to access vulnerable systems. The unknown or 
unaddressed vulnerability is referred to as a zero-day vulnerability or zero-day threat. 
22. What is the principle of least privilege? 
The principle of least privilege, also called "least privilege access," is the concept that a user 
should only have access to what they absolutely need in order to perform their responsibili es, 
and no more. The more a given user has access to, the greater the nega ve impact if their 
account is compromised or if they become an insider threat. 
23. What is MITRE A ack Framework? 
The MITRE ATTACK Framework is a curated knowledge base that tracks cyber adversary tac cs 
and techniques used by threat actors across the en re a ack lifecycle. The framework is meant 
to be more than a collec on of data: it is intended to be used as a tool to strengthen an 
organiza on’s security posture. 
24. What is Zero Trust Framework? 
Zero Trust is a security framework requiring all users, whether in or outside the organiza on’s 
network, to be authen cated, authorized, and con nuously validated for security configura on 
and posture before being granted or keeping access to applica ons and data.  
25. What are some common threat vectors? 
Common threat vectors in cybersecurity refer to the pathways or methods that adversaries use 
to breach systems or networks.  There are some types of threats vectors. 
1. Phishing: Fraudulent a empts to obtain sensi ve informa on such as usernames, 
passwords, or credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy en ty in emails, 
messages, or websites. 
TOP 30 Cybersecurity Interview Ques ons [For Freshers] 
2. Malware: Malicious soware (e.g., viruses, ransomware, spyware, trojans) that compromises 
systems by exploi ng vulnerabili es, o en delivered through emails, downloads, or 
compromised websites. 
3. Social Engineering: Manipula ng individuals into divulging confiden al informa on through 
non-technical means, such as impersona on or psychological manipula on. 
4. Insider Threats: Employees or contractors with access to sensi ve informa on inten onally 
or uninten onally compromising security, either by leaking data or exploi ng their access for 
malicious purposes. 
5. Weak Passwords: Poor password prac ces, like using weak or reused passwords, can allow 
a ackers to easily guess or brute-force creden als and gain unauthorized access. 
6. Soware Vulnerabili es: Unpatched or outdated so ware with security flaws that can be 
exploited by a ackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or deploy malware. 
7. Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks: Public or unprotected wireless networks can be exploited by 
a ackers to intercept data or perform man-in-the-middle a acks. 
8. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): A ackers flood a network or website with excessive 
traffic, causing services to become unavailable to legi mate users. 
9. Third-party Vendors: Insecure third-party soware, hardware, or service providers with 
access to systems can introduce vulnerabili es that a ackers can exploit. 
10. Mobile Devices: The growing use of mobile devices can lead to exposure if these devices are 
not properly secured, with risks including malware, phishing, or lost/stolen devices. 
11. Cloud Security Gaps: Misconfigura ons or poor access control in cloud services can expose 
sensi ve data to unauthorized users or malicious actors. 
26. What is ARP? 
Address Resolu on Protocol (ARP)is a protocol for mapping an Internet Protocol address (IP 
address) to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. 
When an incoming packet des ned for a host machine on a par cular local area network arrives 
at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a physical host or MAC address that 
matches the IP address.  
The ARP program looks in the ARP cache and, if it finds the address, provides it so that the packet 
can be converted to the right packet length and format and sent to the machine.  
If no entry is found for the IP address, ARP broadcasts a request packet in a special format to all 
the machines on the LAN to see if one machine knows that it has that IP address associated with 
it. 
27. What is DHCP? 
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configura on Protocol. It is the cri cal feature on which the users 
of an enterprise network communicate. DHCP helps enterprises to smoothly manage the 
alloca on of IP addresses to the end-user clients’ devices such as desktops, laptops, cell phones, 
etc. is an applica on layer protocol that is used to provide.

28. What are the HTTP response codes? 
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully 
completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: Informa onal responses (100 – 199) 
Successful responses (200 – 299) Redirec on messages (300 – 399) Client error responses (400 – 
499) Server error responses (500 – 599). 
29. What is WAF (Web Applica on Firewall)? 
A Web Applica on Firewall (WAF) is a security solu on that monitors, filters, and protects HTTP 
traffic to and from a web applica on. It acts as a shield between a web applica on and the 
Internet, helping to prevent various types of a acks, such as: 
1. SQL Injec on: A acks that exploit vulnerabili es in the applica on’s database layer. 
2. Cross-Site Scrip ng (XSS): A acks that inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by 
other users. 
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A acks that trick users into submi ng unwanted ac ons 
on a web applica on. 
4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): A empts to overwhelm the applica on with traffic. 
Key Features of WAFs: 
 Traffic Monitoring: Analyzes incoming and outgoing web traffic for malicious ac vity. 
 Threat Intelligence: U lizes known a ack pa erns and signatures to block a acks. 
 Custom Rules: Allows organiza ons to create specific rules tailored to their applica on’s 
needs. 
 Session Protec on: Protects user sessions from hijacking and other unauthorized ac ons. 
 Logging and Repor ng: Provides insights and analy cs on traffic pa erns, poten al threats, 
and incidents.
